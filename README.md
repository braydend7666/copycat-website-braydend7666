        <p>The purpose of the copycat project is to reverse engineer a website. I wanted to reverse engineer Pupilpath because I am the most familiar with it. I've been using pupilpath for years and I love the simple yet snazzy design. It has a very clean design that seemed simple to replicate. However I found out that there would be one BIG problem. When I reduced the opacity of the box, the text faded also. I attempted to use !important, but it never worked for me. My soultion was to copy my exsiting div and use it for it's text not the color. This ended up working and now my copycat website is done! The main purpose of the remix was to give a new color pallet.</p>
